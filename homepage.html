                    This application serves as an interactive study guide through which one can come to learn more about the brain. There are four different areas of study that I have included in this app and they are: history of neuroscience, philosophy of the mind, neurobiology, and computational neuroscience. I used C++ and SDL libraries to complete this project.

                    This program helps users measure their calorie intake and food consumption. The Harris-Benedict algorithms for BMR and calorie levels are utilized, as well as a BMI formula from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the HAMWI formula for ideal body weight. I used Java and Netbeans to complete this project.

                <p class="text-box">
                    The AutoQuiz program uses Python, HTML, and CSS to generate and email a quiz based on random Latin vocabulary. I included a file with thousands of Latin words and definitions so that each quiz generation comes with new/unexpected words. There is also a terminal script that utilizes Crontab and Mutt to automatically send an email containing the quiz each day at a particular time.
